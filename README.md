# Voice Synth Libraries Comparison

A small single-page React app for **comparing JavaScript voice-synthesis (TTS) libraries** side by side. You type a phrase once at the top, and each section speaks that same phrase through a different library — so you can hear the differences using identical input.

Built with **Vite + React + TypeScript** and **pnpm**.

## Libraries compared

| Section | Library | Mode here | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EasySpeech | [`easy-speech`](https://github.com/leaonline/easy-speech) | Web Speech | Modern, typed wrapper around the native Web Speech API. Supports voice, rate, pitch, volume. |
| Speak-TTS | [`speak-tts`](https://github.com/tom-s/speak-tts) | Web Speech | Promise-based Web Speech wrapper. Selects voices by name. Supports voice, rate, pitch, volume. |
| Artyom.js | [`artyom.js`](https://github.com/sdkcarlos/artyom.js) | Web Speech | Older assistant library. Selects voices **by language**, honors rate/volume (no pitch). |
| Talkify | [`Talkify`](https://github.com/Hagsten/Talkify) | Browser (Html5) | Loaded from the Talkify **CDN**; runs on Web Speech. Supports voice + rate. |

## Design notes

- **Shared, normalized controls.** Every section renders the same control surface (voice/language, rate, pitch, volume) via one `Controls` component, but each section **hides the controls its library doesn't support** so the comparison stays honest. The mapping for each library lives in its adapter under `src/synth/adapters/`.
- **Shared phrase, per-section voice.** The text box is global; voice/rate/pitch/volume are per section.
- **Lazy, isolated loading.** Each library is dynamically imported only when its section mounts, and each section is wrapped in an error boundary so a failure in one (legacy) library can't break the page.
- **Talkify is loaded from CDN, not npm.** The `talkify` package on npm is an unrelated chatbot framework — the real Talkify (by Hagsten) is distributed via `cdn.talkify.net`, so it's loaded as a global script at runtime.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open the printed local URL (default http://localhost:5173).

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the Vite dev server. |
| `pnpm build` | Type-check and build for production. |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview the production build. |
| `pnpm lint` | Run oxlint. |
| `pnpm format` | Format with Prettier. |
| `pnpm format:check` | Check formatting without writing. |

## Project structure

```
src/
  components/        Controls, SynthSection, ErrorBoundary
  synth/
    adapters/        One adapter per library, mapping the shared config onto each API
    registry.ts      The list of sections rendered on the page
    types.ts         Normalized SynthConfig / SynthAdapter interfaces
    browserVoices.ts Async Web Speech voice-list loading helper
    loadScript.ts    CDN <script> loader (used by Talkify)
  App.tsx            The single page: shared text box + grid of sections
```

## Caveats

- These libraries (in the modes used here) all rely on the browser's **Web Speech API**. The available voices depend on your **operating system and browser**, and the voice list loads asynchronously — the app waits for it before populating the dropdowns.
- For the most consistent voice selection, **Chrome** tends to expose the richest set of voices (including Google voices).
- Talkify also offers **premium cloud / neural voices**, but those require an API key and are intentionally **out of scope** for this POC — only its free browser mode is used.
- Audio playback requires a user gesture in most browsers; just click **Play**.
